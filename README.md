# ML_Projects
This is a repository with myltiple machine learning projects. I tried my hands on different machine learning algorithms to understand how they work over a datasset. The thing with Machine Learning is that until you dont try your hands on them and perform basic EDA, you will never fully understand how they work.
Also, when you work through the projects, you will understand the areas where you can get stuck and how to get out of it.
